# Internet-of-Things-Connections-Data-exchange-and-security
This project is about securing the connections and data exchange in low power devices used for Internet of Things. Nowadays IoT is becoming very popular, this kind of project can be helpful when talking about the connection between the devices and the issues of security than can occur. Project uses two Raspberry Pi that are connected based on client-server mode, one Pi is the server and the other Pi is the client, Python is used for coding. The purpose of the project is to create a connection that is secure, so the data sent through this connection will be safe. Connection is made safe by implementing the MQTT protocol using username and password. Using some commands from the client data will be sent, after the connection is made, no other device can be communicating with the server at this stage, only one client at a time can send messages to the server. Using a MQTT broker there is the capability to manipulate the model of operation and add more clients to the network, if it's needed. The program is executed from the command line. In few words this project is simulating an IoT system.
